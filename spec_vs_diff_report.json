  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements well. The backend, frontend UI components, theming, and hero image integration are all present. However, the backend uses mutable state via a List object rather than stable variables, which violates REQ-1's explicit acceptance criterion that all state be persisted in stable variables. All other requirements appear to be implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "All state is persisted in stable variables",
      "reason": "The backend uses `let history = List.empty<Exchange>();` which is a regular mutable list, not a stable variable. There is no `stable var` declaration, meaning conversation history would not survive canister upgrades.",
